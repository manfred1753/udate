# Custom Updater

_A component which allows you to track and update custom cards/components and python_scripts._ 

## `5.0.0` Causes major breaking changes
this is due to the restructuring to suit Home Assistant's "Great Migration" at version 0.92

### This component has been disabled from updating itself for a while due to this change, I will add this back at a later time

**To get the best use for this component, use it together with the [tracker-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/tracker-card)**

***

## For installation and updating and for more info about this component have a look at the [Wiki.](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater/wiki/Installation)

# ISSUES?

If you encounter issues with this, please do **not** flood the Home Assistant discord server, or the forums with requests, this is a custom_component and all issues with custom components _should_ be handled by the developer of that component.
