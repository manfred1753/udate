If you are upgrading from a previous version of custom_updater, DELETE `<config directory>/custom_components/custom_updater.py` file on your Home Assistant instance.

# Step 1

Create a directory called `custom_updater` in the `<config directory>/custom_components/` directory on your Home Assistant instance.
Install this component by copying the files in [`/custom_components/custom_updater/`](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater/tree/master/custom_components/custom_updater): [`__init__.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-components/custom_updater/master/custom_components/custom_updater/__init__.py) and [`services.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-components/custom_updater/master/custom_components/custom_updater/services.yaml) from this repo into the new `<config directory>/custom_components/custom_updater/` directory you just created

# Step 2

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
custom_updater:
```

### Config validation

Home Assistant will fail configuration validation the first time after you add this, this is because it does not know of it and it's capabilities (config options)

see the [How it works page of this wiki](https://custom-components.github.io/custom_updater/How-it-works) for details on how to set up your custom elements.
